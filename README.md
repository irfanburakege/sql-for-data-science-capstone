# SQL for Data Science – Capstone Project

This project was completed as the final assignment for the **"SQL for Data Science"** course by IBM on edX.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to apply SQL skills to real-world datasets and answer analytical questions using structured queries. The data was sourced from the **City of Chicago** open data portal and included information about:

- Crime incidents
- Public school performance
- Population and socioeconomic data

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools
- SQL (IBM DB2)
- JupyterLab (via CognitiveClass.ai)
- Cloud-based database environments

## ✅ What I Did

- Queried multiple tables using `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, and 'ORDER BY` clauses.
- Filtered and aggregated data to extract insights on crime rates, school safety, and neighborhood conditions.
- Demonstrated how SQL can be used to support evidence-based decision-making in urban contexts.

## 📂 Files

- `Capstone_Project.ipynb`: Contains all queries, analysis, and final outputs.
- Other '.csv' files for the table data.

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- Data extraction and transformation using SQL
- Analytical thinking and problem solving
- Working with relational databases in a cloud environment
- Using sub-queries
